As a Quality Assurance (QA) Analyst, my role in the SGC project was pivotal in ensuring the reliability and excellence of the app. SGC, denoting "Superior Grading and Authentication," acknowledged the significance of the word "Authentic" by opting for its full display on the card label instead of a mere "A."

The grading scale utilized by SGC is distinguished by its precision, eliminating the "tweener" grades for enhanced accuracy and consistency. Contrary to claims, SGC follows a similar scoring system to PSA, incorporating half points for greater precision, thereby eradicating any ambiguity in the grading process.

With a strong legacy dating back to 1998, SGC has maintained its leadership in authenticating and grading trading cards. Our hallmark lies in providing precise and consistent grades promptly, a service tailored uniquely for the card-collecting community. Over the past 24 years, SGC has emerged as a pillar in the realm of card grading, earning the trust and respect of collectors.

My contributions as a QA Analyst involved a comprehensive array of tests, including Performance, Regression, and Monkey tests, aimed at fortifying the app's functionality and performance. Performance tests were conducted to optimize the app's speed and responsiveness. Regression tests ensured the app's stability and functionality despite updates. Meanwhile, Monkey tests identified potential vulnerabilities, enhancing the app's resilience.
